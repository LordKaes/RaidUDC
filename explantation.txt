FORMULA NÂº1:
This formula calculates the effective defense(*) of an enemy. 


(*) The effective defense is the final calculated defense. 
    For example: the defense can be reduced with the decrease defense debuff. (30% or 60%)
    So, the efective defense will be DEFENSE * 0.3.


This is the enemy defense:

A6                             

Here, it assigns the dec.def:

* IFS ( 
A10 = 30%, 0.7,
A10=60%, 0.4, 
A10="None", 1 )    


Here, it looks for the sets:

* IFS (
C6="Savage", 0.75, 
C6="Savage + Cruel", 0.7,
C6="1x Cruel", 0.95,
C6="2x Cruel", 0.9, 
C6="3x Cruel", 0.85, 
C6="None", 1)                                                           


Here, it looks for the CR blessing:

* IFS ( 
B18 = "N/A", 1,
B18 = "1-2 star", 1 - ( 0.01 * ( C18 / 50 ) ),
B18 = "3-4 star", 1 - ( 0.01 * ( C18 / 40 ) ),
B18 = "5 star", 1 - ( 0.01 * ( C18 / 25 ) ),
B18 = "6 star", 1 - ( 0.01 * ( C18 / 10 ) ) )

Here, it looks for the Cruelty blessing:
* (1 - IFS(
    A18 = "None", 1,
    A18 = "1-2 star", 0.1,
    A18 = "3-4 star", 0.2,
    A18 = "5 star", 0.3,
    A18 = "6 star", 0.4)


------------------------------------------------------------------
What it does: 
Checks which inputted DEC DEF debuff there is (30% or 60%). 
Next it checks for any gear sets, and multiplies the original def by the multipliers
if they were being used, (which reduces the effective def), it checks for blessings,
if there is a match, it again multiplies the effective def, making it smaller.

2. Forumula:

IFERROR ( ( 1 - 0.85 * ( 1 - EXP ( -2 * A26 / 3000 ) ) ) * 0.9

*IF ( 
A14="Yes", 1.05,
A14="No", 1)

*IF (
B14="Yes", 1.08,
B14="No", 1) 

*IF (
C14="Yes", 1.06,
C14="No", 1)

*IF ( 
C10="Yes", 0.75,
C10="No", 1 ) 

*IFS (
B10=15%, 1.15,
B10=25%, 1.25,
B10="None", 1)

*IF (
A23="Yes", 1.2,
A23="No", 1 ) 

*IF(
B23="Yes", 1.1,
B23="No", 1 ) 

*IFS (
D14="N/A", 1,
D14="1 kill", 1.03,
D14="2 kills", 1.06,
D14="3 kills", 1.09, 
D14="4 kills", 1.12)

*IFS (
C23="N/A", 1, 
C23=7.5%, 1.075, 
C23=15%, 1.15, 
C23=22.5%, 1.225, 
C23=30%, 1.3 
) ,"N/A" )

------------------------------------------------------------------
A26 is the effective def, 
basiccally it returns the reciprocal of the def with seers multipliers plus some extra multipliers.

The -2 is used as the negative power,
for example, with this rule of reciprocals 1/3^-2 would be 9

This formula finds the exponential function of the effective defense,
and uses 3000 to represent seers multpiers. 
It checks for weaken, and again multiplies the exponential function of the modified effective
def by the multplier it checks for, repeated mutliple times.
